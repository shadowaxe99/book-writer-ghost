user_guide.add_section("Core Technologies", {
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP)": "The platform utilizes GPT-3.5 16k or GPT-4 for interviewing and narrative generation due to their advanced NLP capabilities. It employs sentiment analysis to capture the emotional context of the interviewee's responses and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract and store critical entities mentioned during the interview.",
    "Machine Learning (ML)": "The platform develops custom ML models to capture and mimic the interviewee's narrative style.",
    "Web Technologies": "The platform uses React for building a dynamic, user-friendly interface, Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and SEO optimization, and MongoDB or a similar database for storing interview data and generated content."
})

user_guide.add_section("Features", {
    "Dynamic Interviewing System": "The platform uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to dynamically generate follow-up questions based on previous responses.",
    "Information Retention": "The platform utilizes GPT-3.5 16k's extended context window of 16385 tokens for retaining a chunk of the interview data. It employs function calling to systematically organize and store data outside the context window for later retrieval.",
    "Prompt Chaining": "The platform employs prompt chaining to maintain context across multiple interactions, ensuring a coherent narrative generation.",
    "Narrative Generation": "The platform crafts exceptional prompts to guide the AI in structuring the autobiography, utilizing the information gathered during the interview.",
    "Editing Interface": "The platform provides a real-time editing interface using WebSocket for immediate feedback and revisions.",
    "Export and Share": "The platform integrates APIs for exporting the generated autobiography in various formats like PDF, ePub, or as a printed book."
